# ThrustRTC

## Progress

The core infrastructure for handling device-viewable data objects has been constructed.

However, I have got time to add any of the Thrust algorithms yet. I'll get back to that soon.

## License 

I've decided to license this project under ["996ICU License"](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/blob/master/LICENSE)

Basically, you can use the code any way you like unless you are working for a 996 company.
